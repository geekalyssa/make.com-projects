### 🩺 Clinic Weekly Reminders (HubSpot → Make Data Store → Mailchimp)

A stateful automation that sends **weekly reminder emails to clinic doctors** about open cases.  
It fetches data from **HubSpot**, stores and deduplicates it in **Make Data Store**, and syncs with **Mailchimp** to trigger campaigns — ensuring no duplicate sends.  
Under the hood, it handles **batch processing**, **API throttling**, and **state resets** each week.
